[[title]] Tell me a bit more
[[date]] 2020-05-10
Here are a few more things about Saishō:
- The theme you see here is based on Micro (μ), which you can find [here](https://paulglushak.com/u).
- It is using [Parsedown](https://parsedown.org/) to parse MD files. I will implement Parsedown-Extra as well.
- Custom metadata tags (`[[title]]`,`[[date]]` and `[[description]]` are being used by this template).
- Very simple, custom template system.
- **There are bugs. Beware.**
